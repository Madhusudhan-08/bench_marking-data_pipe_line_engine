## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Data Acquisition Layer for a scalable, component-based system prioritizing data quality, multi-dimensional benchmarking, transparency, and adaptability. The architecture ensures support for diverse data sources (structured and unstructured), rigorous validation and cleaning, harmonization for analytics, and an auditable data flow.

## Architectural Principles

- **Modular Components:** Each key function (integration, validation, cleaning, harmonization, auditing, storage) is isolated for scalability and independent upgrades.
- **Extensible & Adaptable:** New data sources, rules, or processing modules can be added via configuration, supporting evolving business needs.
- **Transparency:** Every data movement and transformation is logged and traceable.
- **Data Quality:** Systematic checks and harmonization ensure reliable and comparable data for downstream analytics.

## High-Level Flow

**Data Sources →** **Unified Ingestion Engine →** **Data Validation →** **Data Cleaning →** **Data Harmonization →** **Logging & Audit Trail →** **Data Lake/Warehouse**

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Data Sources

- **APIs/XBRL/PDF Parsers:** Automated acquisition of financial data (e.g., SEC filings, company statements).
- **Web Scraping Bots:** Gathers unstructured data such as news sentiment, product reviews, and feedback.
- **File Uploads/Portals:** Allows companies to submit structured or semi-structured files (e.g., ESG, HR data).
- **Direct Company Submissions:** Secure portals for proprietary or internal data uploads.

#### Input Example:
- API response (JSON/XML), parsed PDF statement, CSV file upload, HTTP scrape result.

### 2. Unified Ingestion Engine

- Orchestrates receipt of data from all sources.
- Attaches initial metadata (source, time).
- Routes data to the validation pipeline.

### 3. Data Validation Module

- **Schema Checks:** Ensures records match expected templates.
- **AI/ML & Rule-Based Validation:** Flags anomalies, outliers, missing/invalid fields.
- **Error Handling:** Auto-corrects minor issues, escalates major errors for review.

### 4. Data Cleaning Module

- Fills in missing values where possible or flags them.
- Normalizes outliers per business logic.
- Standardizes formats (dates, currency, case).

### 5. Data Harmonization Module

- Maps all data fields to internal standards (e.g., currency, time zones).
- Converts and aligns metric definitions and units.
- Ensures data is comparable across sources and time.

### 6. Logging & Audit Trail

- Captures each processing event and transformation.
- Stores error logs, diagnostics, and data lineage information.
- Supports real-time monitoring and historical troubleshooting.

### 7. Data Lake/Warehouse

- Stores cleaned, harmonized data for robust analytics and benchmarking.
- Metadata enables traceability for all records.
- Supports downstream reporting, machine learning, and business intelligence.


## 8. Extensibility & Maintenance

- **Adding New Data Sources:** Register connectors in configuration. Minimal code change.
- **New Validations/Cleaning Rules:** Plug-in new rules or models. Modular approach prevents system disruption.
- **Documentation:** Each module maintains version-controlled documentation and processing metadata.
- **Monitoring:** Dashboards provide oversight of data flow, errors, and quality metrics.

## 9. Transparency

- Every record is traceable to its source, processing steps, and current state.
- Processing logic is documented and auditable.
- Errors and changes are logged for compliance and root cause analysis.
